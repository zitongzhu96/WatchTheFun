# CIS557 Project: Photo-sharing Social Network APP (Milestone1)

# Planning: User stories, Story points (6 points)

## Specifications:

We will use ***GitHub*** and ***Extreme Programming (XP) methodology*** when implementing CIS557 project. As a reminder, XP provides 29 simple rules to be followed in terms of Planning, Managing, Designing, Coding, and Testing.

1. You will ***create and configure a project in your GitHub repository***. (see useful links below).
2. You should create a ***wiki page in your GitHub repository***. The page will list and describe your user stories and story points.
3. Each ***user story should be listed in the GitHub’s tracker***  as an issue. You should label your issues.

### Your wiki page should be organized as follows:

1. A three-column table listing the user stories and story points
  Example:

|     US #      | User Story    | User Story    |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
|     1         |   User story  |     1.5       |
|     2         |   ...         |     ...       |



2. A description of the meaning of points value
Story points should be based on your assessment of: 
   - The amount of work to do
   - The complexity of the work
   - Any risk or uncertainty in doing the work

Example:  
 - Assign 1 point to a task that should take one person to complete in one day. Assign 0.5 point  to a task that should take one person to complete in 4 hours (half a day)
 - Another example 1 point for “easy” task, 3 points for a “medium” task and 5 points for a “hard” task.


3. A detailed description of each user story
You should list the features along with the story points calculation.

Example:
* User profile:
A click on the user’s icon should display their profile page. The profile page should include the following:
   - The profile picture, the number of posts, the number of followers
   - The most recently uploaded photo. There should be a small thumbnail image of the photo and the date it was uploaded. 
   - The photo of the user that has the most comments on it. There should be a small thumbnail of the photo and the comments count.

* User points:  It can take one a day and a half to complete this feature (1.5 points)

## Submission:
- Do not forget to regularly commit your work to GitHub.
- Only the last push before the due date will be graded.

## Evaluation:
- The user stories document will be evaluated based on credible effort to complete this assignment
- You will receive feedback on your user stories document
- An “official list” of user stories will be released by the course staff before the beginning of the “iteration phase”
